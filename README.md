# *LIBFT*
This project is one of the first and major in **_School 42_**.
This is `C` library with my own implementation of some of the `libc` functions including some additional useful ones.
At the first stage of schooling (about 10 projects for me) we had to use `C` language, and Standart C Library is forbidden for us! So, starting with such basic utilites as `memcpy(); memmove(); strlen();`, I wrote this library for use it in all of the following `C` projects. Now, in addition to the basic functions, it contains a number of useful modules.
Here is a partial list:
- simple memory manager
- dynamic array (similar to a `vector` in c++)
- dynamic cyclical deque
- dynamic list, realised on array (for best performance)
- get_next_line() (aka getline() from libc) + fast_input_gnl()
- ft_printf() (my own printf() from stdio.h)
- output buffer (implemented for ft_printf() but as part of the libft)
- print_memory (like `xdd` util in unix)
- and other
### More detailed description of my library [posted on wiki](https://github.com/elijahkash/libft/wiki) (in work now)

## How to use:

#### 1. Compile

#### 2. Debug

#### 3. Quick opportunity test

#### 4. If you use Visual Studio code

#### 5. Cmake

## Contributors

- I would like to say a few words of gratitude to my teammate @odrinkwa ([@semrunner](https://github.com/SemRunner)) by the `ft_printf` _project_, for develop `float/double/long double` part of printf! Thanks a lot!
