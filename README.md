# *libft*
This project is one of the first and major in **_School 42_**.
This is `C` library with my own implementation of some of the `libc` functions including some additional useful ones.
At the first stage of schooling (about 10 projects for me) we had to use `C` language, and Standart C Library is forbidden for us! So, starting with such basic utilites as `memcpy(); memmove(); strlen()`, I wrote this library for use it in all of the following `C` projects. Now, in addition to the basic functions, it contains a number of useful modules.
Here is a partial list:
- simple memory manager
- dynamic array (similar to a `vector` in c++)
- dynamic cyclical deque
- dynamic list, realised on array (for best performance)
- get_next_line() (aka getline() from libc) + fast_input_gnl()
- ft_printf() (my own printf() from stdio.h)
- output buffer (implemented for ft_printf() but as part of the libft)
- print_memory (like `xdd` util in unix)
- end other

Also, wona to say a few words of gratitude to my teammate @odrinkwa ([@semrunner](https://github.com/SemRunner/semrunner)) by the `ft_printf` _project_, for develop `float/double/long doule` part! Thanks a lot!
